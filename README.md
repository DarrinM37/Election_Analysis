Election-Audit Summary-

As demenstrated within the script, it can quickly and accuratley provide basic information on all canadates that exist in the data. This script can easily be modified to:

1. By adding a new grouping within the code we can add political affiliation sections.

2. By adding headers and modifing the code we can then provide results to multiple elected offices. This would allow the code to be ran once per election instead of individual races.
